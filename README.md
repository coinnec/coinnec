A Blockchain based decentralized business platform.


Coinnec is a blockchain powered anonymous decentralized platform with personalized token based on Ethereum's smart contract ecosystem for transactions with ERC20 standard. Coinnec is an innovative cryptocurrency powered solution for the business that allows service providers to monetize their work in a collaborative P2P network platform. They can set a price for their services and provide reliable offers for clients.

The revolutionary Coinnec platform is powered by its namesake Coinnec tokens. These tokens, built around Ethereum smart contract technology is the primary medium of value exchange over the Coinnec business ecosystem. These tokens can be easily stored on the user’s preferred device using a personal desktop wallet, ERC20 compatible web-based wallets like MyEtherWallet or within the Coinnec platform itself. 

Coinnec tokens make it easy for the users to purchase services and other content on the platform. Like any other popular cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ether and more), Coinnec tokens can be traded against other cryptocurrencies or fiat on some of the leading exchange platforms.

Coinnec adopts a pretty straightforward process for providers and users to sell and buy services and other digital content easily. The provider, willing to rent his time for a specified service on Coinnec uploads the offer file on the platform. Once uploaded, the information will be published in a peer to peer network, which is visible to the users. A user, browsing through the platform, or searching for a particular services can easily discover relevant offers. 

Once a decision is made, user will pay 50% for the service selection with Coinnec tokens to run the service providing process and 50% remainder fee once it’s complete to finalise the transaction. The transaction will be visible on the blockchain, thanks to its transparency. Following the confirmation of respective transaction on Ethereum blockchain, the provider will receive funds into their wallet. The provider will receive 100% of the transaction minus a small fraction, payable to Ethereum network as gas to fuel the transaction. 

Coinnec offers providers complete freedom to set the price and provide samples of their work to users. The sample work can be some demonstration images of the offered services.

Coinnec will continue to introduce new ways of work monetization for the benefit of providers. At the same time, end users stand to benefit from lower prices as providers can afford to let go of the commissions and third-party fees which they would have otherwise incurred over conventional distribution channels like banks or other payment brokers.
